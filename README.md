# FlashTool-OP

A tool made with Netbeans and launch4j based on Java

## Getting Started

Download the Tool from here * [FlashTool-OP](https://github.com/Franco28/FlashTool-OP/releases) 

### Prerequisites

You must have java 64bits installed on your pc

### How it works

- Exec the "Tool.exe" in any folder that you want to use it, you will see a Menu Option, choose the Tool (OP5, OP5T, XIAOMI MIA2/6X Tool)
- You need internet connection to use the Tool, if this no happens Tool will close it
- If you want to use the option "Download the ROM with Tool" you need to pay attentio  because maybe some link ROM will be outdated, iÂ´ll try to stay update
- If you want to flash any TWRP, this will be downloaded and flashed, but remember to put your device on Bootloader mode and ready to flash
###### If you want to help me with ROM links and warning me if there's a new ROM available and i didn't update the Tool, you can contact me and send me a message!
